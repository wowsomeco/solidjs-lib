# solidjs-lib

A Collection of experimental components, hooks and extensions for [solidjs](https://github.com/solidjs/solid)

## Getting Started

Right now it serves as a git submodule, no npm for now.
Add it as a submodule in your project by running:

```console
git submodule add git@github.com:wowsomeco/solidjs-lib.git src/lib
```

from your root project.

Then, in your `tsconfig.json` of the project, add:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "~lib/*": ["src/lib/*"]
    }
  }
}
```
